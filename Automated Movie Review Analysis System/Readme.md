## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis** project! This project focuses on building a sentiment classifier that can determine whether a given movie review is positive or negative. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression with gradient descent, this project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and classifying the sentiments expressed in movie reviews.

## ✨ Features

- **🔠 Word Feature Extraction**: Convert text data into numerical feature vectors based on word occurrences.
- **🔤 Character N-gram Feature Extraction**: Capture subword information by extracting character n-grams.
- **📈 Logistic Regression Classifier**: Implemented using gradient descent for efficient training.
- **🧪 Dataset Generation**: Create synthetic datasets for testing and validation purposes.
- **📊 Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance on training and validation datasets.
- **🔍 Error Analysis**: Analyze misclassifications to understand model weaknesses.

## 🚀 Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- **🐍 Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **📦 pip**: Python package installer.
